                </div>
                <p>The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, a pioneering international oceanography initiative led by NASA and CNES, with contributions from UK and Canadian space agencies, was launched on December 16, 2022. This trailblazing "water mission" measures water elevation across Earth's oceans, lakes, rivers, and coastal regions, delivering unprecedented data as the first of its kind.<br>
                Our laboratory focuses on analyzing SWOT's groundbreaking dataset. We use traditional physical oceanography techniques to study small-scale ocean dynamics while integrating modern tools, such as machine learning, to identify ocean features.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The ocean is a dynamic, turbulent system where eddies—swirling features resembling pond ripples—drive over 80% of its kinetic energy. These eddies significantly influence the transport of heat, nutrients, and tracers like carbon, profoundly impacting the atmosphere, cryosphere, and hydrosphere.<br>
                Mesoscale eddies, spanning hundreds of kilometers, have been extensively studied over the past three decades, enabled by modern technologies such as space-borne altimetry. Their critical role in ocean dynamics is well recognized.<br>
                Submesoscale eddies, ranging from a few kilometers to tens of kilometers, are less understood but vital for vertical transport of heat, nutrients, and tracers.<br>
                Our research focuses on understanding these small-scale processes by measuring and surveying their horizontal and vertical structures. A key aspect of the research involves reconstructing mechanisms from incomplete datasets to reveal their nature and broader significance. We integrate satellite and in-situ measurements with numerical modeling and theoretical approaches to study ocean dynamics.</p>

The new methodology leverages two surface observables—sea surface height (SSH) and sea surface temperature (SST)—to reconstruct the ocean's interior structure from surface fields. This decoupling of surface pressure (SSH) and buoyancy (SST) is critical, as it enables the reconstruction of the vertical tilt of mesoscale eddies, a fundamental property essential for understanding their dynamics.</li>

                <p>Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for analyzing large datasets, and it has gained significant traction in oceanography. With collaborators from the ML domain, we explore applying ML techniques to oceanographic data, particularly in the context of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission. We aim to develop innovative methods for feature identification, data assimilation, and predictive modeling in ocean dynamics.</p>

                <p>Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) forms the cornerstone of physical oceanography. It enables us to comprehend the essence of observed phenomena and develop improved models for predicting future ocean circulation and climate.<br>
                GFD studies the complex movements of air and water on Earth. These flows are nonlinear, chaotic, and complex in nature. They are hard to solve with just pencil and paper. We often simplify these equations by making practical assumptions, then use computer programs to solve the simplified equations or directly simulate them using discretized numerical models.</p>
